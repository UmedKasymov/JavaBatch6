		/*Class and Object in Java
		 * OOPs in Java-->Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation
		 * 
		 * What is Class in Java?
		 * Class is blueprint/template
		 * 
		 * "A class is a blueprint or prototype that defines the variables and the methods (functions) common to all objects of a certain kind. An object is a specimen of a class.
		Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. 
		For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, 
		and methods, such as drive and brake. 
		A Class is like an object constructor, or a “blueprint” for creating objects."
		 * 
		 * Car: Class in which we define 
		 * feature/
		 * 
		 * and 
		 * 
		 * actions/behavior of FUTURE OBJECTS
		 * 
		 * Feature: model, size, color, 4 wheels, engine, doors, 
		 * actions: drive, accelerate, stop, break, make noise, 
		 * 
		 * House: 
		 * Feature: rooms, kitchen, doors, bathroom, garage
		 * 
		 * car1.make="lamborghini";
		 * car.model="gallardo";
		 * car1.color="blue";
		 * car1.door=2;
		 * 
		 * car1.make="BMW";
		 * car.model="M5";
		 * car1.color="pink";
		 * car1.door=4;
		 * 
		 * car1.drive();-->lamborghini
		 * car2.makeNoise();-->BMW
		 * 
		 * TV
		 * feature: screen, color, size, brand 
		 * actions: watch movie, play music, display images
		 * 
		 * Dog://class or template
		 * feature: breed, color, name, age
		 * actions/behavior: eat, sleep, bark, run
		 * 
		 * dog1.breed="Shih tzu";
		 * dog1.color="yellow";
		 * dog1.name="Lucy";
		 * dog1.age=2;
		 * 
		 * In Programming:
		 * template- is Class
		 * feature- variables
		 * actions/behavior-methods
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Object--> instances of the a class
		 * 
		 * // Once we create CLASS-->inside we will define variable and methods
		//When we create Object of the class/instance of the class
		//...that object will have access to all variables and methods from that class.
		
		// we create as many objects as we need
		
		//Main method-->is a special method and it's needed for the program executon
		
		//During execution, Java 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Classes without main method is NOT EXECUTABLE
		 * 
		 * Methods in Java:
		 * Built in
		 * User defined: methods that define by us/programmers
		 * 
		 * In Java we have 2 data types:
		 * Primitive: 8(char, boolean, int ...etc)
		 * Non_primitive : (string) Objects(String, Car, Dog, Phone...etc
		 * 
		 * Methods in Java:
		 * Built in
		 * User defined: methods that define by us/programmers
		 * 
		 *  Methods in Java:
		 *  with parameters 
		 *  and without
		 *  
		 *

	/*
	 * I see some of you didn't understand the benefits of method overloading. It
	 * gives FLEXIBILITY, CLARITY, AND INTUITIVENESS to our codes. Think of:
	 * System.out.println(); using this method, you can print String, int, double,
	 * boolean etc.. Do you call different sysout to print all these datatypes? NO,
	 * you type only one sysout and it can print all data types. Internally
	 * corresponding method will be called but here where int the class that you
	 * type sysout, one sysout can print all. println method is overloaded.
